I am a 4th year PhD student studying cognitive neuroscience, advised by Prof. Justin Gardner. I am interested in how visual experience is constructed by the brain. 

Prior to joining Stanford, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I worked in the lab of Prof. Mark Dâ€™Esposito. From 2015 to 2016, I was a visiting researcher in the lab of Dr. Martin Rolfs at BCCN Berlin.
