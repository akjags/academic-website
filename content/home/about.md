# About Me

I am a 2nd year PhD student studying cognitive neuroscience, advised by [Prof. Justin Gardner](http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/shared/research). I am interested in how visual experience is constructed by the brain.

Prior to joining Stanford, I was at the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked in the lab of [Prof. Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu). I have also worked as a visiting research assistant in the lab of [Dr. Martin Rolfs](http://www.rolfslab.de/) at [BCCN Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/).
